# A-Star-pathfinding
This is my implementation of A* pathfinding algorithm in Unity for future projects.

Assets is separated in 2 groups: visuals and logic so it can easily extracted into other projects for use. 
There are 2 implemented grids in the moment: square grid and hex grid. 

You can check out the demonstration of algorithm in the GIF file below.
